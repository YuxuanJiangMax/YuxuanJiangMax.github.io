Here is **Yuxuan Jiang (Atlas, [江雨瑄](/file/江雨瑄简历.pdf))**.

I am a Msc from the **University of Leeds**, majoring in **Environment and Development**. My bachelor's degree is in **Physical Geography and Resource Environment** from **Beijing Normal University (BNU)**. I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof Jiang Lingmei](http://www.slrss.cn/sourcedb_slrss_cas/kydw/yjy/202006/t20200628_566012.html),  [Prof Qu Yonghua](http://www.slrss.cn/sourcedb_slrss_cas/kydw/fyjy/202006/t20200628_566005.html) and [Prof Zhao Hanpin](http://geo.bnu.edu.cn/jgszbf/jzyjbk/jzryzc/33918.html) when I spent time at BNU, and equally fortunate to be supervised by [Prof Imogen Rattle](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/8918/dr-imogen-rattle) when I studied abroad in Leeds. Here is [my Resume](/file/ResumeYuxuanJiang.pdf).

Academic Background
======
**<font color='red'>[Highlight]</font>I am looking for PhD to start in 2025 Fall. Contact me if you have any leads!** [talk with me](/contact me/)

- **Sep 2015 - June 2019:** Beijing Normal University (BSc)
- **Jan 2021 - Mar 2022:** University of Leeds (MSc)

<br>

Research Background & Interests
======
- Mechanisms Influencing Sustainable Consumption Behaviour
- Digital Extension of Resource and Environmental Economics
- Synergies between Environmental Policy and Video Marketing

During my master’s program, my research focused on **investigating and quantifying the relationship between public acceptance of geothermal energy utilization facilities in Yorkshire and their policy impacts** (e.g., regulatory frameworks, subsidy mechanisms, and community engagement strategies). My undergraduate research centered on **assessing the performance disparities among soil moisture measurement devices across diverse application scenarios**, with emphasis on methodological standardization and field applicability.

My scholarly interests lie at the intersection of **human-natural system interactions**, particularly in elucidating **synergistic evolution and coordinated development pathways between societal systems and the environment**. By integrating perspectives from **environmental economics, management studies, and social sciences**, I aim to analyze how economic activities drive environmental externalities and devise **evidence-based regulatory interventions**. This interdisciplinary approach seeks to optimize **environmental policy formulation** and advance **regionally tailored sustainable development agendas**.

# Vision & Commitment

We are navigating an era of rapid environmental transitions, where **predictable environmental shifts** (e.g., decarbonization mandates, circular economy transitions) are reshaping individual and collective livelihoods. My career aspiration is to contribute rigorously to this transformative field, leveraging **data-driven policy analysis** and **stakeholder-centered governance frameworks** to foster societal well-being through environmentally resilient development.
