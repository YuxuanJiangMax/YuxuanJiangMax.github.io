**The project examines the quality of the product by conducting both indoor and outdoor observation experiments and comparing and analysing the domestic SoilNet Qu sensor with the foreign Em-50 sensor 5TM, thus providing support for the validation of soil moisture products at the remote sensing scale. **Moisture test results are based on drying method measurements as reference values, and temperature test results are based on standard thermometer measurements as reference values. Designing the indoor experiment, it was found that when measuring soil moisture, the average absolute error of the Q sensor measurement was 1.29% at the minimum and 3.43% at the maximum, with a mean value of 2.5% and a standard deviation of the absolute error of 2.1%.The average absolute error of the measurement of the 5TM sensor was, at the maximum, 5.67% and at the minimum, 3.74%, with a mean value of 4.9% and a standard deviation of the absolute error of 3.7%.The Q sensor was in the accuracy is better than the 5TM sensor, while the stability is also better than the 5TM sensor. When measuring temperature, the average absolute error of the 5TM sensor is 0.48°C for the mean value, and the maximum value is 1.23°C. The minimum value is 0.03°C, and the standard deviation of the absolute error is 3.7%. The minimum value is 0.03°C and the standard deviation of error is 0.26°C. The mean absolute error of the Q sensor is 2.90°C. The maximum value is 5.19°C. The average absolute error of the Q sensor is 2.90°C. The maximum value was 5.19°C, the minimum value was 1.49°C, and the standard deviation was 1.20°C. The Q sensor measurement error was large, and there was an obvious linear change rule with temperature. After that, supplementary experiments in real soil environment outdoors were carried out to verify the indoor tests. And the design of pavement models with different water permeability capacity was briefly analysed by temperature and moisture measurements using the Qu number picker Q sensor. (Abstract)
