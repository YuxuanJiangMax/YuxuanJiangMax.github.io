This paper is about correcting for methane emissions in the four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios using sectoral methane emissions data from the Global Methane Initiative and the reduction targets in the pledges, combined with the sectoral methane reduction potential from the literature. This paper is written in the natural climate change style, using the FaIR climate model. Other models are left for future work.
